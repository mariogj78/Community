VERSIONS:
I made two versions depending on database: MySQL version is the most complete and Postgres version that missed password encryption for connecting to database.
Comunity.zip Version 1.0 (mysql)
Colonia.zip  Version 1.0 (PostgreSQL)

SETUP AND INSTALLATION:
#######################################################################################################################################
APPLICATION WITH MYSQL VERSION:
I. Prerequisites:
1) Maria DB 10.2 or MySQL 5.5 (for the Database)
2) Apache 2.4.29 or above (for the Web Server application)
3) PHP 7.1.2 or above (I tested on php.7.2.2) (for the language on the web server application

II. Setup:

Files Required:
- Joomla_3.8.7-Stable-Full_Package.zip
- CreateFraccionamientoMySQLDB.sql
- Comunity.zip
- sourcerer-v7.2.0.zip
- changeString.php

1) Unzip Joomla_3.8.7-Stable-Full_Package.zip into htdocs folder (or whatever your hosting provider gives you)
2) Follow the setup for Joomla installation (remember to choose MySQL) but you will need to identify the database and tables prefix as follow:
	- db: fraccionamiento (if your hosting provider or database administrator cannot give you this name then 
			you have to change the loadScript for MySQL database creation file: CreateFraccionamientoMySQLDB.sql lines 16 and 17)
	- dbprefix: p246x_ (mandatory prefix for assigning relationship with users privileges on Community project)

3) Load database backup CreateFraccionamientoMySQLDB.sql with your favorite MySQL IDE (Recommended HeidiSQL)
4) Unzip Comunity.zip into htdocs folder
5) Change Configuration.php file on Community folder with the data for the same Configuration.php file on the Joomla folder. 
	(because it has the database data connection parameters)
6) Create at least 1 user and 1 superuser on Joomla Content manager. 
	You can enter the Administrator section URL in my case was http://localhost:8080/Comunity/Administrator/
7) Install by Upload Package file option when you enter on the top Menu: Extensions / Manager path on Joomla Content Manager.
8) Change the parameters of the database on the LoadCatalog.php file inside Community/misphp
9) For the password you need to use the file changeString.php and enter in the first input text your real password for database connection 
	and push Cambia Button (first button on left), this will give you the encrypted password on the second input text. 
	You need to paste it in the line 21 for the variable assignment.
	I recommend checking your file editor regarding change of charset. If you are using windows use notepad to edit the file.
10) Test the application and check if missing configuration. You can use the php.ini and httpd.conf files included on the zip distribution to check
	minimal options required or use HelloWorld.php and HelloDatabase.php to check if the prerequisites and database connection works fine.
	
Enjoy.
